# FINAL

I mostly have it working, but the reload is a little glitchy. It was supposed to reload after all blanks are filled (the right number of buttons are clicked) but it doesn't work automatically so you can hit spacebar to reset to the next sentence. That causes the problem of the WRONG text box not reappearing though (it's supposed to pop up every time).
